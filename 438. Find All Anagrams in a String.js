/**
 * Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.
 * You may return the answer in any order.
 * An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
 * typically using all the original letters exactly once.
 * Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
 * Output: [0,6]
 * Explanation:
 * The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
 * The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
