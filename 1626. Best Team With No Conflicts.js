/**
 * You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score.
 * The score of the team is the sum of scores of all the players in the team.
 * However, the basketball team is not allowed to have conflicts. A conflict exists if a younger player has a strictly higher score than an older player.
 * A conflict does not occur between players of the same age.
 * Given two lists, scores and ages, where each scores[i] and ages[i] represents the score and age of the ith player, respectively, return the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: scores = [1,3,5,10,15], ages = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: 34
 * Explanation: You can choose all the players.
 *
 * @param {number[]} scores
 * @param {number[]} ages
 * @return {number}
